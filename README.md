# Introduction

## Overview

This data visualization project aims to showcase the Dengue fever statistics in Singapore in an easy to read and interactive dashboard format. The dashbooard contains relavent information about Dengue fever cases in Singapore from 2012 to 2022. This includes information about the number of cases, deaths, and other relevant statistics.

<br>

## Rationale 

Currently dengue statistics made available to the public are scattered across multiple formats (PDFs, APIs etc).  By extracting and combining all the relavent data from these sources, anyone interested in the Dengue epidemic can easily monitor all the relevant statistics in a single page.

<br>

## Key Data Points

1. Dengue Fever
2. Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever
3. Deaths
4. Active Clusters
5. Breeding Habitats
